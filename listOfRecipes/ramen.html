    <h1>Steps
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and ginger. Stir it around and simmer for about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms to the saucepan and sauté them until they've softened.</li>
                <li>Drop the chili paste into the pot and stir it around to coat the mushrooms.</li>
                <li>Stir in the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, salt, and sugar. Pour both the chicken and dashi stock into the pot and give everything a good stir.</li>
                <li>Let the soup simmer for about 15 minutes. In the meantime, you can cook your ramen noodles and prep your toppings.</li>
                <li>Once the soup has had a chance to simmer, give it a taste test and adjust the heat and soy sauce to your liking.</li>
                <li>When the noodles are ready, strain them and transfer them to a large bowl—preferably a Ramen bowl. Transfer some broth to the bowl over the noodles and garnish the bowl with your toppings of choice.</li>
            </ol>
